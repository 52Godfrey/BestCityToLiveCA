## Results

  Working on this project we find out:
  
    - Than higher house price than lower crime rate with some exeption for San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa County
    - Than lower houses price and population than higer crime rate.
  
  We have statistics for all possibe bedroom choices, but we don't want to put to many pictures to Read.me file. There is one example to prove our conclusions:
